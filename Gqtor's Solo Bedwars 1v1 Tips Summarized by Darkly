GQTOR'S  SOLO BEDWARS 1v1 TIPS
SUMMARIZED BY DARKLY

General Tips:
 • Use all the gold on first rush
 • Buy ladders or water buckets
 • Learn Scorpion Bridging and 2-Stacking
 • Learn tnt-jumping
 • Learn ladder-clutching -> Make sure to hold shift when ladder-clutching 
 • Buy fireballs when the iron gen is fast
 • Don't go for the bed when taking a lot of damage - be patient and wait on their island
 • In 1v1 tournaments always go for red team
 • If you lose your bed ditch it and go to mid

Advanced Tips:
 • If you have 3 leftover gold buy waterbucket and drop it in your spawn area -> if enemy drops tnt on your bed use the waterbucket to negate tnt-damage
 • Kb-sticks are super overpowered, if you have the gold to buy one, then buy one
 • If your opponent lost their bed and goes for mid go to mid for 2 emeralds and buy jump and speed to win a 1v1 against them
 • Make platforms on your bridges to have an advantage in bridge fights
 • Place blocks behind ladders for even more kb-protection
 • Go for trades when low on hp
 • Avoid fights when your bed is gone (especially on bridges)
 • Don't invis on scorpion bridges
 • Block off water when opponent water clutches
